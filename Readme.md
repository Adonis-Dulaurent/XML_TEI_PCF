 # Archives of the Secretariat of the French Communist Party

Welcome to this repository, whose purpose is to highlight and preserve the archives of the Secretariat of the French Communist Party. For this project, we will focus on the oldest reports (dating from September 1944). These documents are encoded in **XML** and follow **TEI** standards.

## Historical Context:

The French Communist Party (PCF) was the most influential political party in France following World War II. In 1943, the PC-SFIC (French Section of the Communist International) dissolved and took on the name PCF. At this time, the party became rooted in the working class, rural areas, and intellectual circles, allowing it to capture 26.2% of the vote and secure 159 seats in the 1945 elections. These documents from the Secretariat do not reveal the party’s political decisions but rather show how it organized itself in the lead-up to the elections.

## Presentation of the Sources:

The documents consist of three meeting reports from the French Communist Party:

   . Doc 1: September 4, 1944
   . Doc 2: September 11, 1944
   . Doc 3: September 18, 1944

These documents are preserved in the departmental archives of Seine-Saint-Denis (54 Avenue du Président-Salvador-Allende, 93000 Bobigny, France).

Each document is two or three typed pages detailing decisions and assignments, along with the names of agents.

## Project Objectives:

  . **Accessibility**: By digitizing and encoding these texts, we aim to make them accessible to the general public.

  .  **Support for Historians** : Through encoding, particularly of agent names and locations, we hope to assist historians researching the political and social history of France after World War II.

  . **Open Source**: All XML files are published under an open license to encourage research and scientific use.

## Repository Structure: 

- `~/ReunionPcfEncoding/`: This directory contains the XML files, as well as the DTD.

- `~/Sources/`: Contains the meeting reports in PDF format.

- `~/Transcription/`: Offers transcriptions in `.txt` format of the various sources, prepared by us.
